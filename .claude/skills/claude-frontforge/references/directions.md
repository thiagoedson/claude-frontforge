# Design Directions

This skill is for **interface design** — dashboards, admin panels, apps, tools. Not for marketing sites or landing pages.

Before writing any code, think about what this specific product needs to feel like. Don't default to familiar patterns.

## Questions to Ask

- **What does this product do?** A finance tool needs different energy than a creative tool.
- **Who uses it?** Power users want density. Occasional users want guidance.
- **What's the emotional job?** Trust? Efficiency? Delight? Focus?
- **What would make this memorable?** Every product has a chance to feel distinctive.

## 6 Starting Points

These are lenses for thinking, not categories to pick from rigidly.

**Precision & Density** — Tight spacing, monochrome, information-forward. For power users who live in the tool. Think Linear, Raycast, terminal aesthetics.

**Warmth & Approachability** — Generous spacing, soft shadows, friendly colors. For products that want to feel human. Think Notion, Coda, collaborative tools.

**Sophistication & Trust** — Cool tones, layered depth, financial gravitas. For products handling money or sensitive data. Think Stripe, Mercury, enterprise B2B.

**Boldness & Clarity** — High contrast, dramatic negative space, confident typography. For products that want to feel modern and decisive.

**Utility & Function** — Muted palette, functional density, clear hierarchy. For products where the work matters more than the chrome. Think GitHub, developer tools.

**Data & Analysis** — Chart-optimized, technical but accessible, numbers as first-class citizens. For analytics, metrics, business intelligence.

You might blend two. You might find your own path. The point is to think deliberately about what fits.

## Color Foundation

Don't default to warm neutrals. Consider the product:

- **Warm foundations** (creams, warm grays) — approachable, comfortable, human
- **Cool foundations** (slate, blue-gray) — professional, trustworthy, serious
- **Pure neutrals** (true grays, black/white) — minimal, bold, technical
- **Tinted foundations** (slight color cast) — distinctive, memorable, branded

**Light or dark?** Dark feels technical, focused, premium. Light feels open, approachable, clean. Choose based on context, not preference.

**Accent color** — Pick ONE that means something. Blue for trust. Green for growth. Orange for energy. Violet for creativity. Don't reach for the same accent every time.

## Layout Thinking

Let content drive the layout:

- **Dense grids** — when users scan and compare lots of information
- **Generous spacing** — when users need to focus on fewer things
- **Sidebar navigation** — multi-section apps with many destinations
- **Top navigation** — simpler tools with fewer sections
- **Split panels** — list-detail patterns where context matters

## Typography Tone

Typography sets emotional tone:

- **System fonts** — fast, native, invisible (utility-focused)
- **Geometric sans** (Geist, Inter) — modern, clean, technical
- **Humanist sans** (SF Pro, Satoshi) — warmer, approachable
- **Monospace influence** — technical, developer-focused, data-heavy

The right choice depends on who's using it and how it should feel.
